Most of my life I have been driving in New Zealand, where the traffic is quite sane and most people follow the rules very well. Of course every once in a while you will see a reckless driver running a red light, jumping into the traffic and swerving into another lane. All of these bad eggs happen in every country where driving exists I believe, and the only thing that makes a difference between how pleasurable driving is is how often you see these reckless drivers.

That said, I always find it less appealing than taking public transport or cycling. Driving is a very big responsibility, and any slight amount of carelessness can cause lots of grief and tragedy. Hence I am always a big fan of cities that have a comprehensive public transport system. It really helps when you don't need to whip out the car every time you need to go buy groceries, meet a friend or even just to head to the beach. Parking is always an issue in a lot of places, and often I'd just take a bus instead of driving to the mall, saving plenty of time and money, and not to mention that I get to catch up on my reading in the bus.

Sadly however, the majority of places in the world do not have very good public transportation, making cars really really important in these places. In these places, having a license to drive is almost as important as having shoes to walk with. This is why it is always important to check if the place you are going to allows you to drive with your current license, and how you would go about driving in that very small chance when you really need to be able to drive, such as in an emergency.

For me, a New Zealand license does not allow me to drive in Japan. But since the AA issues an International Driving Permit which allows me to for one year, I can make sure that being able to drive should not be an issue. IDPs are issued and accepted with a current valid driver's license by most countries that are signatories of a certain 1968 convention about traffic rules. In my case it only costed me $20 and an hour at the AA center to get one with my license.

Another way I try to avoid driving is by using a bicycle. Not only are bicycles healthier, they are more efficient and cost less to maintain too. After a year of cycling, it is possible to raise your speed to about 40km/h for most journeys, making the mode of transport almost as effective as a car! It gets even better when there are good cycling lanes across the city, making commutes to and from work both healthy and cheap.

Here in this photo is a bus in wellington that runs off electric wires overhead. Its got a lot of advantages over trams, especially the fact that it can pull over and get out of the way. All in all, I love ways to get around without using cars. I hope that more cities around the world will adopt good public transport systems like Singapore and Tokyo, making travel easier, cost less and become much less risky for everyone.
