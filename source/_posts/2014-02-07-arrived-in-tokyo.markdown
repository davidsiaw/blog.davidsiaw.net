Cairns airport is very interesting. Its very small and very quiet. So boarding an international flight on it is like getting on a very secret flight to ship something very secret to people who do not exist. Very very dodgy. The gate to the plane looks so desolate it seems like I may or may not be shipped to a destination that I want to go to.

But alas I was sent to the right place and the plane (which was colored differently from all the other Jetstar planes too) faithfully moved me from Cairns to Tokyo as promised. I was so happy i brought a large bottle of water into the plane. I could've dehydrated from the air in the plane for the 7 hours.

Some changes have been effected in Narita apparently. Instead of taking the train from the satellite building to the main building, you now have to walk. Also, we were redirected to the immigration counters further down the end of the airport closer to the train stations.

In the arrival halls too, there are these funny things welcoming you to Japan now. The girl stood somewhere outside but near to uncanny valley. I guess the Japanese can do this kind of stuff now.

They are actually matte surfaced glass with a projector behind them. It was a really big attraction for the kids while the parents were putting their families' documents together.
