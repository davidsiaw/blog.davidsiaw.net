It turns out clownfish are sometimes called "anemone fish". The anemone here are called green-tipped anemone. Most of us likely recognize clownfish from the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finding_Nemo" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a>. These cute clownfish and anemone come from a friend's aquarium that provides me with endless fun watching fish. Highlights of my day include times when the anemone curls up into a tiny ball of tentacles.
