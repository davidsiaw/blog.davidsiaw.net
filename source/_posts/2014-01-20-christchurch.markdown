Since I am leaving Christchurch, a city in which I have lived in for 8 years, I thought that it would be appropriate to at least make one post about this place. <!--more--> Since the city was damaged in an earthquake 2 years ago, a lot of the things photographed here no longer exist. But these are still great pictures to remember Christchurch by.

Often in the summers there would be a gondola taking tourists down the Avon River. It is as much a sight to behold as it is for the tourists sitting in the boat. The city on weekends is usually bustling with tourists coming to take pictures of the Christchurch Cathedral, which in my opinion should be restored to its fullest despite what the Anglican Church decides.

Another great place in the city that I love going to is the flower garden in Mona Vale and the Botanical Gardens. They have a great collection of flowers where I can test my camera skills on. During spring there are only small sets of flowers growing, but the garden reaches full bloom during the summer when it is the warmest. Most of the color seems to come from the roses.

Every end of the year, there would be a big New Year Party in the Cathedral Square area where great Irish bands would come together and sing awesome songs and generally get a large crowd in on a lot of good fun.

A great place to be in summer is also Sumner Beach, behind large red coloured cliffs that were unfortunately the source of many large boulders during the earthquake.

The Christchurch Armageddon was the only anime/games convention in Christchurch, and it was held in the Convention Center, which no longer exists. It was fairly large before the earthquakes and was a great place to spend the weekend while it was on.

New Brighton Beach was another one of my favorite places to go to on a hot summer's day. The long pier stretches pretty far out to sea and is always very windy.

Finally a great park called Halswell Quarry Park has always been a great place to walk. It is well situated for nice views of the city on the hiking trail and it also has nice little gardens that make walking fun.

All in all, Christchurch has always been a very pleasant, quiet city. Its a great place to retire, and I hope that despite the damage the earthquake has done, I hope that it returns to becoming a great city to be in.
