As most of you have noticed I have mostly been posting a lot of random stuff and not much about what I was doing. Well that is because what I have been doing is not very interesting. I have mostly been spending my time moving things around and selling stuff. A bunch of things besides moving things around need to be done while moving like:
<!--more-->
- Cancelling the internet plan
- Cancelling insurance
- Telling the post office where your new address is
- Cancelling your phone line
- Getting all that in the new place you are going to
- Making sure you have enough baggage allowance to carry through

Its always so important to also ensure that all the people who know you know that you have left, so that people don't feel left behind, or find that you are not there. Tying up loose ends is such an important business, it takes an entire reminders list on my phone.

In the end however, its a great way to finish off a chapter in life. We as humans always require some kind of closure in our life, and once that happens we can move on.
