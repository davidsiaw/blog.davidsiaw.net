At some point most of us are going to realize we have too many things, and its usually when you are getting ready to move houses. I cut down heavily on my buying things after 2010, naturally resulting in most of my stuff being pre-2010 stuff. But this did not free me from the fact that I had too many things.

This is a photo of the remaining stuff that I keep close to my heart after clearing my room. There was actually 10x as much stuff but I got rid of the other 90%. One wonders how I managed to keep all that stuff in a room the size of 6 tatami mats. With room to spare!

After that I proceeded to decide what to pack into my suitcase and it turns out I had a further pile of stuff that I wanted to bring with me. Each item was carefully considered based on its size, weight and importance. I kept thinking that "oh this is small I'll just toss it in", "oh thats not too bad I should be able to fit it in"; the sum of which is a suitcase that won't close.

And thus after a few months of wrestling with the final boss (my container loads of stuff), I finally realized that I need to learn to live with less things. Yet it still doesn't help that I have a fudgeload of stuff.

I cannot wait to get this done. Once this is over, I will make sure the next big thing I buy is a house.
