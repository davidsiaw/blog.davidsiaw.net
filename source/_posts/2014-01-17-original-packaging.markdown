What do all of you think about keeping the original packaging of items you buy? I personally have a very big habit of keeping every piece of packaging that my items come with. Besides knowing that its a big waste to throw something that probably constitutes 20% of the price of the item I bought, I also like to keep them so that mailing them is easier when I decide to sell them.

The original packaging to me is the best packaging there is for a particular product. It fits the item so snugly you often don't even have to worry about cushioning it when you mail it out as a parcel! Here is the box for a Hard Disk Enclosure. Often electronics with very nice shapes come with support things with very lousy shapes, like power blocks with plug pins attached. The original packaging removes the need for you to figure out how you want to protect the thing when you mail it out.

Another big advantage of packaging is storage. Often, the packaging is made in such a way that protects the delicate parts of an item from compression. It would also be structured so that the box does not collapse in the way you don't want it to. Also, they are usually a very nice cuboid shape because that is very easy to store, leaving you with a simple tetris game when it comes to arranging them inside a bigger box!

One of the issues of keeping original packaging however, is always space. The packaging can take up space, and if it contains plastics shaped like something, or polystyrene, it takes up even more space! This is one of the things I was faced with during this move. Often I would keep as many pieces of packaging as I can in order to be able to pack things away nicely. But this time I was forced to throw most of it away.

Above is a picture of a big Borders liquidation sale in Melbourne, when Borders was closing down. Hundreds of things were being sold and they obviously do not keep the original packaging. When this happens, all the things come across as stuff, and makes it very unattractive to look at. I still bought stuff because it was great to be able to get jug cables for like fifty cents or so.
