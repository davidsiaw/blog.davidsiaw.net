Living in Japan has been a journey of discovery for me, but in the last year I have neglected to update this blog with my experiences so I think now is high time I do so. Let us start off with a few culinary delights I have discovered in Japan in no particular order or importance.

First of all is the Baumkuchen. While not exactly Japanese, if you live in Europe you would probably find this familiar. Japanese Baumkuchen is a relatively smooth interpretation of the German cake. The batter used is very fine resulting in a very sponge cake-like texture. Also they are sold pretty much anywhere in the ubiquitous convenience stores around Tokyo. They are a great snack to have around.

Gyuusuji is a skewer with bovine intestines and a piece of fairly lean meat. While offal is fairly off-putting to some, it is one of my favorite foods, and Japan caters to that particular craving of mine. Here you find gyuusuji in the form of oden which is a soup-based food that is available from autumn in all the convenience stores in Japan. You basically go to a convenience store and pick out chunks of food that cost between 100 to 200 yen each. They are a great relief from the miserable cold and hunger that the long winter imposes on you.

Jagabutter is really just a portmanteau of Jagaimo and butter. Jagaimo means potato and is a great snack typically only found at food stalls during festivals. Unlike the above two snacks, this one isn't sold at convenience stores, so you actually have to go out of your way to get them. Nevertheless, this snack consisting of a large heavily boiled and then roasted potato with a chunk of butter and salt tastes incredibly good and is my favorite pick-me-up snack.

Most people know about onigiri now, thanks to the spread of Japanese cuisine in the West. These rice balls are a great go-between for lunch and dinner during times when you are hungry but it is still a few hours till the next meal. However, the Japanese are not content to make just rice balls. Every month the convenience stores will come up with all sorts of wild and wacky additions to the rice balls such as egg, cheese and tomato. Here you can see a Meat Doria Onigiri and a Cheese Onigiri. All very outlandish but very tasty at the same time.
