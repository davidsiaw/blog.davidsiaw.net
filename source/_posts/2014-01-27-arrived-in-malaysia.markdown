Today I made journey to Kuching from Singapore. My flight would take me from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur and then to Kuching. In the morning me and my friends had a snack at the Airport Staff Canteen at Changi airport. It is actually hidden away quite well behind a corridor and stairwell, but has cheap and awesome local food. So if you arrive in Changi Airport hungry, I actually recommend that you come here for something, its a lot better than Svensen's or Waraku and cheaper too! Simply look for the Airport Staff Canteen in the Starbucks side of Terminal 2 up the escalator.

The food you see here is called Ais Kacang (Ais Kachang). One of my favorite desserts.

After having a fairly hearty dessert, a 1 hour delay and a 30 minute flight to Kuala Lumpur, I arrive at KLIA just minutes shy of the takeoff time of my connecting flight. Luckily since I am flying Malaysia Airlines, there was actually staff waiting at the gate to get me to the next plane quickly so I don't miss it. Quite impressed. AirAsia last time simply left me alone when they delayed and told me to contact the 'ground staff'. (geram)

After 10 minutes of walking through an airport thats simply too big for what it does and clearing immigration to get to the domestic airside, I was finally on my flight to Kuching and was treated to some awesome Chilli Chicken with Rice. I always love the way this airline cooks carrots and potatoes, where they are nice, soft and tender.

After an hour and a half of flying, I finally arrive back in my hometown Kuching. I shall leave finding my house on the photo as an exercise to the reader. The temperature in Kuching is much milder and slightly cooler than in Singapore, despite being almost the same latitude. It must be the valley.

And I got to eat my long-time favorite food, Kueh Chap. It is a soup with pig organs in it, fried tofu, eggs, lean pork and rice flour pieces. It is served with some nice chilli that really enhances the flavor. While I have had kueh chap in other places, none really compare to the one served in Thompson's Corner at Tabuan Jaya.
