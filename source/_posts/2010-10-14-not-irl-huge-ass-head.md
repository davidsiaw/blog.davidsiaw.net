Recently me and my friends have been playing AIKA Global. Some MMO that involves the standard grinding, levelling and crafting kinda thing that almost every MMO has. Except this one's special. The heads of the GMs are REALLY HUGE. Seriously, you'd think they'd come up with something less ... laughable

Massive head is massive.
