I believe that in the postmodern world, a hotel's goodness should be rated first and foremost by its WiFi provisions. A hotel that does not provide completely free and fast WiFi to its customers is in my humble opinion, a crappy hotel. In this day and age, communications are so important for us to function properly and efficiently as a society. The lack of Internet will simply result in social decline and students who cannot vent on the internet to go outside and cause riots.

This is the issue in Park Royal Hotel in Melbourne at which I have had the misfortune of staying at. WiFi here is charged per unit data apparently, and it was difficult to justify paying anything more than the room rates for Internet.

The cool thing was I was put on the 7th floor where I would live in one of the rooms that had great numbers on them.

Melbourne airport was busy as always, making me wonder why it is a little too small for the number of passengers it currently handles. People would overflow beyond the chairs and tables prepared to write on their departure cards, which I think are pretty funny things anyway.

This is the first time also that I tried wrapping my baggage. It is pretty neat, and relieves you of the fear of your baggage tearing for any stupid reason. I don't think it protects the baggage in any way besides scratching damage, but it does a great job of compacting the bags.

After a gruelling (not really) 7 hour flight where we flew over Ayers Rock and the pilot was nice enough to bring the plane to a lower altitude for a closer look, I finally arrived at a nice airport. Changi always amazes me at how big and busy it is, and yet it manages to be just pleasant enough for tired travellers.

The long escalators are another thing about Changi. These escalators bring you down to the MRT platform from the airport terminals. There are two of them on either side of the train platform, one connecting to Terminal 3 and another to Terminal 2.

After that we headed down to a Japanese buffet place near Clarke Quay where a bunch of people were dancing to the trance music playing from the other side of the river. Pretty cool stuff.
