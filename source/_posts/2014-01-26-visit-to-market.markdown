Today I made a visit to the local market after a nice little breakfast of Roti Prata. In Malaysia, this is called Roti Canai. It is supposedly an Indian food related to Naan bread, but I believe it has been greatly localized for local taste. It is a pancake made with a very oily dough and heated on a metal surface to a slight crisp. In this picture the Roti Prata contains onions and eggs. In this post we are going to look at a wide variety of ingredients used in the Chinese food palette.

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food02.jpg 500 312 Ikan Bilis %}

What you see in this picture are bags of a fish we call Ikan Bilis or, Anchovies. Often they are dried immediately after catching and sold that way salted or unsalted, and are used as an addition to lots of stir-fried dishes for flavor or a nice garnish on some dishes, giving them a nice additional crunchy texture.

Shiitake! From the name you can tell they are very popular mushrooms with the Japanese. They are also cultivated and eaten heavily by Chinese and Koreans, and apparently have medicinal properties too.

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food04.jpg 500 312 Seaweed %}

Another wonderful piece of food is seaweed. Admittedly I had a serious problem of nausea when I encountered this food as a kid, as the years went by it grew on me, and I now enjoy it. Here we see packets of grilled seaweed which is most commonly seen in Western countries as the wrapping for Sushi. They are actually great eaten on their own too.

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food07.jpg 500 312 Fish Maw %}

Dried Fish Maw seen here is another great food we get a lot in Chinese cooking. Often we eat this stuff in a soup where it adds nice soft texture, but they can also be eaten in their dried form as a snack. Fish Maw is actually an internal organ of a fish called a "swimming bladder". It does not taste as disgusting as it sounds though.

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food09.jpg 500 312 Shark's Fin %}

Shark's Fin is a delicacy in Chinese cuisine and also considered a luxury food due to its cost. It also tastes very very nice. In soups they are often transparent, but this is the Shark's Fin in its packaged form. It is very often eaten in a thick soup with mushrooms, eggs and vinegar.

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food10.jpg 500 312 Snacks %}

During Chinese New Year we place lots of snack food on the table for people to eat. We then perform a lot of visiting to each others homes to meet and enjoy each other's company in celebration of the coming plentiful harvest. Here you can see some of snacks that are placed on the tables, various nuts, dates, sultanas and fried mini dumplings.

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food13.jpg 500 312 Tea %}

Here you sea a packet of a type of Chrysanthemum tea. We Chinese have a huge variety of teas to choose from when we are bored, and practically almost every aromatic flower gets pulled in to make teas. Legend has it that tea was invented by an emperor when he drank from a cup of boiling hot water which had a Jasmine flower that fell inside.

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food14.jpg 500 312 Dried Fruit %}

We also have a huge selection of fruits dried and seasoned in many many different ways. I particularly enjoy a special kind of dried apricot coated with a herb, giving it a slightly bitter taste on the outside but a nice sweet and sour taste from the inside.

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food16.jpg 500 312 Herbs %}

As with dried fruits and teas, Chinese herbal tradition seems to know no limits. Here we can see some strange herbs that I don't quite know but smells like it has lots of medicinal properties. Herbs are also often consumed as soups and seasonings on foods as a form of supplement to our daily nutrient intake. 

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food17.jpg 500 312 Birds Nest %}

Birds Nest is another very luxurious, expensive food in Chinese cuisine. The extraction of Bird's nests take place in sparrow nests in caves and is a very dangerous process as the caves that birds nest in usually have very steep, treacherous cliffs and are extremely large. These nests, like spider webs are created using a bird's coagulating saliva, and are said to have great medicinal properties.

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food18.jpg 500 312 Sausages %}

Here is a sight not seen besides during festivals, a nice assorted array of various kinds of sausages made with different meats stuffed into intestines of different types, or not even stuffed at all. Chinese sausages have very strong and wonderful flavours and are usually seasoned heavily with herbs and spices to make them even tastier.

{% img /images/2014/01/southeastasian-food20.jpg 500 312 Cuttlefish %}

Finally, there is cuttlefish, great squids that are dried and eated on their own or as a seasoning to mostly stir fried foods. They are extremely tasty, and some of them are fairly tough too. As a schoolkid I often enjoyed them as a snack, where they are sold as strips of cuttlefish or in packets of dried cuttlefish sheets.
