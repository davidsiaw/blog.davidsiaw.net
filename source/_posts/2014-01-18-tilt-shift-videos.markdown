I have always enjoyed the effects of a <a href="/2010/10/01/tilt-shift/">tilt shift</a> lens, and I am always very excited by videos made with tilt shift lenses, especially time lapse videos. It always makes big cities look like little toys and drives my imagination. The first video here is a video of Christchurch back before the earthquake. It is beautiful isn't it?

Here is another video that's full of awesome. This one is taken by mockmoon from the Telecom Center in Tokyo. The great number of containers just shows how busy the port is. All that activity coupled with the toylike look makes the video look surreal. It gives us that perspective on life that really minifies it and helps us realize that whatever little business we are always preoccupied with, there is always a greater pattern and plan to all the bustle around us.

Another one from New York. Here you get to see people on battery park look like little bugs, and the water washing up on the shore as if it was just a little puddle, and toyish looking machinery galore. It makes me wonder if kids will ever play with toy tractors again in this age of Call of Duty and Minecraft.

And here's a little video that really drives home the miniature look of all these videos, it starts with a kid playing with a snowmobile. The pine trees look a lot like ferns and moss. Having visited a skiing village several times, it is incredible to see all the trails from a vastly different point of view. It also puts into view the amount of work required to make great ski mats for us to ski on!

Finally, another play on the toyish look from Paris Disneyland. Here the really toy look makes Disneyland look like a very elaborate hobbyist model of the theme park, with automated toy boats, bumper cars and spinning wheels.
